## Development

Download the Expo Client on your mobile phone (Android or iPhone). Open the Expo Client and select the ‘Scan QR code’ option. Make sure your development machine and the mobile phone are on same WiFi network. Start the app with:

```bash
yarn start
```

Then, wait for the QR code to appear. Scan the QR using your Expo Client (with version 26.0.0, Expo had to discontinue the QR scan feature on iPhone, you can still scan the QR code from iPhone’s camera and it will prompt you to open it using Expo app). Our app should now open on your phone.
